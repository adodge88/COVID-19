This project aims to create a dashboard to track COVID-19 outbreak that was initially detected in Wuhan (Hubei, China), and was declared pandemic by the WHO on Wednesday 3-11-2020.

## The project consists in 1) Data manipulation (ETL) 2) dashboard creation.

# Data Manipulation:
- Data Extraction: 
    original data: three csv  files from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE) Coronavirus repository https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
- Data Transformation: 
    Pandas using .melt() to transform the tables and partial-pivot the DataFrame. 
- Data Loading: 
    Data was loaded to postgresSQL using sqlalchemy and the transformed table was exported as csv

# Dashboard:

To share and visualize the data, we used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap grid -> in JavaScript. 

The dashboard has:

- Interactive map using leaflet.js library and a plugin library leaflet-timeline-slider (https://github.com/svitkin/leaflet-timeline-slider). The data is fetched using D3, and filter by date. The data markers reflect the number of cases and is updated after changing the date.  
- The card data was first calculated and the pushed to the html using d3
- Scrolling features on the map were disabled for usability and scroll bars were added to the country count and article cards for the most updated data entry.
- We used flask to scrape for article title and date of article but because it runnes on a local server this feature can not be deploided.
